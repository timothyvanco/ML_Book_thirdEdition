#Embedding a Machine Learning Model into a Web Application

In this chapter, I was working on embedding a machine learning model into
a web application that can not only classify, but also learn from data in real time. 
The topics that I worked on are as follows:

- Saving the current state of a trained machine learning model
- Using SQLite databases for data storage
- Developing a web application using the popular Flask web framework
- Deploying a machine learning application to a public web server


To sum it up:

I learned how to serialize a model after training and how to load it for later use cases. Furthermore, 
I created an SQLite database for efficient data storage and created a web application that lets
me make my movie classifier available to the outside world

This is how it looks like after I wrote some basic movie review:
