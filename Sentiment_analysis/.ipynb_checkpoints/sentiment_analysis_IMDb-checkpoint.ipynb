    "Thanks to modern technologies, we are now able to collect and analyze such data most efficiently. In this chapter, we will delve into a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) called sentiment analysis and learn how to use machine learning algorithms to classify documents based on their polarity: the attitude of the writer. In particular, we are going to work with a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and build a predictor that can distinguish between positive and negative reviews\n",

    "The topics that we will cover in the following sections include the following:\n",
    "- Cleaning and preparing text data\n",
    "- Building feature vectors from text documents\n",
    "- Training a machine learning model to classify positive and negative movie reviews\n",
    "- Working with large text datasets using out-of-core learning\n",
    "- Inferring topics from document collections for categorization\n",

The powerful and rich family used their influence to cover the murder for more than twenty years.

    "# Topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling describes the broad task of assigning topics to unlabeled text documents. \n",
    "For example, a typical application would be the categorization of documents in a large text corpus of newspaper articles. In applications of topic modeling, we then aim to assign category labels to those articles, for example, sports, finance, world news, politics, local news, and so forth. Thus, in the context of the broad categories of machine learning we can consider topic modeling as a clustering task, a subcategory of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is a generative probabilistic model that tries to find groups of words that appear frequently together across different documents. These frequently appearing words represent our topics, assuming that each document is a mixture of different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to an LDA is the bag-of-words model that we discussed earlier\n",
    "in this chapter. Given a bag-of-words matrix as input, LDA decomposes it into two new matrices:\n",
    "- A document-to-topic matrix\n",
    "- A word-to-topic matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA decomposes the bag-of-words matrix in such a way that if we multiply those two matrices together, we will be able to reproduce the input, the bag-of-words matrix, with the lowest possible error. In practice, we are interested in those topics that LDA found in the bag-of-words matrix. The only downside may be that we must define the number of topics beforehand—the number of topics is a hyperparameter of LDA that has to be specified manually."
