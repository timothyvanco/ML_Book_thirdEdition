# DATA PRE-PROCESSING

The quality of the data and the amount of useful information that it contains are key factors 
that determine how well a machine learning algorithm can learn. 
Therefore, it is absolutely critical to ensure that we examine and preprocess a dataset 
before we feed it to a learning algorithm. In this file, 
I was working on the essential data preprocessing techniques that will help to build good machine learning models.

Main topics in data pre-processing:
- Removing and imputing missing values from the dataset
- Getting categorical data into shape for machine learning algorithms
- Selecting relevant features for the model construction


I was working with wine dataset. This is picture of Feature importance in that dataset, 
which can help in getting rid of some part of data in future - make dataset smaller.
