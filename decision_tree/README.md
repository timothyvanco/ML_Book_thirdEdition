# DECISION TREE

A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, 
including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only 
contains conditional control statements.

to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal, but are also a popular tool in machine learning.

I used Decision Tree model on Iris flower dataset:
